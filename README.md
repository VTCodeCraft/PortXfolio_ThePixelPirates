## 🧪 How It Works

1. When the website loads, a fullscreen preloader appears.
2. The text types out three messages:
   - `Ahoy! Welcome to Our Creative Realm 🏴‍☠️`
   - `The Pixel Pirates`
3. A blinking cursor adds realism.
4. Background waves move subtly using animated SVG.
5. Glowing effects pulse behind the text.
6. After the final line, the preloader fades out, revealing the portfolio.
